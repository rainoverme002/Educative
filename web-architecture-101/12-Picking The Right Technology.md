# Picking The Right Technology

- Real-time Data Interaction
  - For instance:
    - a messaging application,
    - a real-time browser-based massive multiplayer game,
    - a real-time collaborative text editor
    - an audio-video streaming app
  - NodeJS enable us to write these kind of apps
  - [Uber story on NodeJS](https://eng.uber.com/uber-tech-stack-part-two/)

- Peer to Peer Web Application
  - For instance:
    - a P2P distributed search engine
    - a P2P Live TV radio service
  - Checkout FreedomJS
  - [Netflix researched on P2P](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/netflix-researching-large-scale-peer-to-peer-technology-for-streaming/)

- CRUD-based
  - MVC (Model View Controller) architecture
  - Spring MVC, Python Django, Ruby on Rails, PHP Laravel, ASP .NET MVC

- CPU & Memory Intensive Applications
  - Big Data Processing, Parallel Processing, Running Monitoring & Analytics
  - C++, Rust, Java, Scala, Erlang
  - Go to write apps for multi-core machines & handling a large amount of data
  - Julia a dynamically programmed language built for high performance & running computations & numerical analytics

## Key Things To Remember When Picking the Tech Stack

- Be Thorough with the Requirements
- See If What We Already Know Fits the Requirements
- Does the Tech We Have Picked Has An Active Community? How Is the Documentation & the Support?
- Is the Tech Being Used by Big Guns in Production?
- Check the License. Is It Open Source?
- Availability Of Skilled Resources on the Tech
