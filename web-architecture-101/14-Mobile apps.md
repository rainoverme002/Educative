# Mobile Apps

Depends on the strategy to approach the market

- Mobile-only
  - the business operates just via mobile
- Mobile-first
  - users of the business will use its services via its mobile client
  - desktop-based website interface is secondary
- Mobile Friendly â€“ Responsive
  - as web-first or desktop-first
  - responsive websites

## Types of Mobile Apps

- Native App
  - built exclusively for a particular OS
  - high performance
  - a consistent user interface
  - Look and feel of the native OS.
  - have to develop dedicated apps for every platform
  - Android: Java, Kotlin or C++
  - IOS: Swift, Objective C

- Hybrid App
  - primarily built using web-based technologies
  - run in a native-container
  - communicate with the native OS via a wrapper or a middle layer
  - not as performant and smooth as native apps
  - React Native, Flutter

### When Should We Pick A Native App For Our Use Case

- we have heavy, graphic and hardware requirements
- the app is pretty complex & is reliant on hardware access
- needs to support new mobile OS features

### When Should We Pick A Hybrid App For Our Use Case?

- the app requirements are simple, there is nothing complex
- cannot afford dedicated codebases for platforms
- test the waters with a pre-alpha release or an MVP

## Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

- run in the browser of both mobile and desktop devices
- PWAs are not a replacement for native apps
- The general trend
  - search engine traffic via their responsive mobile websites
  - then try to direct that traffic to their native mobile apps

## Mobile Backend as a Service

- a cloud-based service model that
  - takes care of the backend infrastructure of our mobile app
  - enables us to focus on the business logic and the user interface.
- Google Firebase, AWS Amplify, Parse

### When Should You Use A Mobile Backend as a Service

- great for mobile-only services
- great for use cases where you do not need a custom backend
- best for apps like mobile games, messaging apps, to-do list kind of apps
