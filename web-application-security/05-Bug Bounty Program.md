# Bug Bounty Program

- a program that give reward if someone find vulnerability on a system

## Security.txt

- The security.txt is a proposed standard to advertise the security policies of a website.

Example: [Facebook Security.txt](https://www.facebook.com/security.txt)

## HackerOne

- a BBP Platform, there are reports, payouts, stats for every website that posted. So the security researchers can test and get a reward

## Dealing With Researchers

- Communication is the key
- As ethical hacker we want inform that we can reproduce the issue and are working towards identifying whether it can be fixed.
- Positivity in your mind
- As organization we need to motivate, thank and reward this ethical hacker

But not every hacker have good ethics

- A lot of hacker demand the payout first, before they reveal the vulnerabiliy
- Just Ignore them
